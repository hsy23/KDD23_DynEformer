class TimeSeriesTransformer(nn.Module):
    """
    This class implements a transformer model that can be used for times series
    forecasting. This time series transformer model is based on the paper by
    Wu et al (2020) [1]. The paper will be referred to as "the paper".

    A detailed description of the code can be found in my article here:

    https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-make-a-pytorch-transformer-for-time-series-forecasting-69e073d4061e

    In cases where the paper does not specify what value was used for a specific
    configuration/hyperparameter, this class uses the values from Vaswani et al
    (2017) [2] or from PyTorch source code.

    Unlike the paper, this class assumes that input layers, positional encoding
    layers and linear mapping layers are separate from the encoder and decoder,
    i.e. the encoder and decoder only do what is depicted as their sub-layers
    in the paper. For practical purposes, this assumption does not make a
    difference - it merely means that the linear and positional encoding layers
    are implemented inside the present class and not inside the
    Encoder() and Decoder() classes.
